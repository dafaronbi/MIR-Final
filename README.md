# MIR-Final


## Subjective Test
Test for yourself! look at the examples generated by the model and compare them to ground truth. There are four examples in the folder "Genenerated Audio Subjective Test". One example is predicted on the training set while all of the others are predicted on the test set. Examples were picked at random

## Run the model on your own
Because of the size, the model and data are not included in this repository. If you can generate the data with the dataset_gen.py, however, you will need to follow the instructions to install [spiegelib](https://spiegelib.github.io/spiegelib/getting_started/installation.html). All other requirements can be installed using the requirements.txt file. You will have to change a few things in the scripts to get them to train or generate the exact audio you want (dataset_gen.py generates stft features not melspectrogram and dooes 3 batches of 3000 instead of one batch of 9000 for the training set).

If you want my specific data set just ask and I'll find a way to send it to you, but right now it's too big for github.
